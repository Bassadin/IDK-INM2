## Test Data

I used ChatGPT to generate a sample `.xml` file. The file is located in `data/` and is called `data.xml`.

My prompt was: `Write an .xml file with 10 addresses including, as data fields: name, surname, street, house number, PLZ, city, telephone number, email address, birthday`
Unfortunately, ChatGPT only generated 5 addresses, but that should be enough to start.
